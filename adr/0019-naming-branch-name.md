# Naming Branch Name

* Status: accepted

## Context

We run too many separate sprints and our naming gets mixed up. Also it is difficult to manage when too many branches are gathered under one folder.

## Decision

Branch names should be named in such way:  `Channel Name/Sprint Name/Task Code + Name` 
For Example: `MPDP/Sprint1/MPDP-1050-ProductDetailPage`  or  `DISCO/Sprint50/IOSDISCO-1250-FixWidgetHeight`

## Consequences

All branches were divided into different folders with channel name.
